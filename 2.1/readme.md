# Symphony Opus 2.1

This is an important add-on for Opus 2.

It uses Simplified Attention Mechanism (FeedForward is all you need, our unpiblished technique) in Actor and Critic

It is an addon, because without it the algorith can solve most of the tasks.
But it is best suited for Partially Observable State Space in Time domain.
It switches between Time domain and State space domain to take into account short history.
