1. harmonized state
2. careful TD3, element-wise minimum between 3 predictions
3. rectified Huberr symmetrical/assymetrical error loss function
4. emphasis on the beginning of training, number of steps grow exponentially
5. less priority for older data
6. random initialization prevent the same initial states in the buffer.
7. epsilon external-noise and latent noise
