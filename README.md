I wrote a short book with a careful explanation: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CKYWHPF5

1. harmonization of the neural network
2. careful TD3, element-wise minimum.
3. rectified Huber symmetrical/assymetrical error loss functions
4. "movement is life" concept
   
   additionally:
5. fading replay buffer: old transitions fade away gradually
6. random initialization prevent the same initial states in the buffer.
7. exploration-nois

   My heart belongs to Jesus. Jesus is Love. Whoever seeks Him, finds Him.
