I wrote a short book with a careful explanation: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CKYWHPF5

1. harmonized state and network
2. careful TD3, element-wise minimum directed towards element-wise mean.
4. rectified Huber symmetrical/assymetrical error loss functions

   additionally:
5. emphasis on the beginning of training, number of steps grows exponentially
6. less priority for older data
7. random initialization prevent the same initial states in the buffer.
8. optional: epsilon external-noise and latent noise

   My heart belongs to Jesus. Jesus is Love. Whoever seeks Him, finds Him.
