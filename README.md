I wrote a short book with a careful explanation: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CKYWHPF5

1. harmonization of the neural network
2. careful TD3, element-wise minimum of 3 predictions.
3. rectified Huber symmetrical/assymetrical error loss functions
4. "movement is life" concept
   
   additionally:
5. fading replay buffer: old transitions fade away gradually
6. emphasis on the beginning of training, number of steps grows exponentially
7. random initialization prevent the same initial states in the buffer.
8. exploration-noise, reward/punishment, etc

   My heart belongs to Jesus. Jesus is Love. Whoever seeks Him, finds Him.
